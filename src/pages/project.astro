      <h1>The Project</h1>
      <p class="lede">
        EvOCRO investigates how learning and cognitive flexibility develop across the lifespan of crocodiles
        and how individual differences shape these abilities, using Morelet’s crocodile as a model system.

      <h2>Why crocodiles?</h2>
      <p>Crocodiles are long-lived predators equipped with highly developed sensory systems and living in complex and dynamic environments. However, their cognition has been explored far less than that of birds or mammals. Yet, crocodiles occupy a key evolutionary position: they belong to the archosaurs and diverged from birds (and dinosaurs) more than 250 million years ago, making them essential to understanding how cognition evolved within this evolutionary lineage. Studying their behavior therefore fills an important gap in comparative research and challenges the idea that only "classically complex" species are suitable models for studying animal cognition.
      </p>

      <h2>Research objectives</h2>
      <p>
        Studying crocodilian cognition helps bridge an important evolutionary gap and informs conservation efforts,
        environmental adaptability, enrichment practices and welfare guidelines.
        The project addresses three main objectives:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>RO1 – Ontogeny of learning:</strong> how learning abilities change from hatchlings to juveniles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RO2 – Individual differences:</strong> how sex and personality traits such as exploration or shyness
          affect learning performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RO3 – Cognitive flexibility:</strong> whether crocodiles adapt when reward contingencies are reversed
          (reversal learning).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Approach and work packages</h2>
      <p>
        EvOCRO integrates behavioural ecology, comparative psychology, and evolutionary biology within an international collaborative network.
The project leverages the unique opportunity to work with populations of <em>Crocodylus moreletii</em> raised in semi-natural conditions, which offer an ideal balance between experimental control and ecological realism. Here, we will observe the animals, test their cognitive abilities, and compare individuals of different ages, sexes, and personalities.
      </p>

      <h3>WP1 – Ontogeny of learning</h3>
      <p>
        WP1 tests how learning develops from hatching to the juvenile stage using positive reinforcement, two-choice
        discrimination tasks and reversal learning to quantify age-related cognitive changes.
      </p>

      <h3>WP2 – Individual differences</h3>
      <p>
        WP2 assesses sex and personality traits (e.g., boldness, exploration, response to novelty) and links them to the learning data
        generated in WP1 to understand how stable behavioural tendencies influence cognition.
      </p>

      <h3>WP3 – Cognitive flexibility</h3>
      <p>
        WP3 expands the learning tasks by repeatedly reversing stimulus–reward associations. This allows the project
        to quantify flexibility and measure how quickly individuals adjust to new rules.
      </p>

      <h3>WP4 &amp; WP5 – Training, management and communication</h3>
      <p>
        WP4 focuses on scientific training, open science practices and career development.  
        WP5 covers dissemination, publications, outreach activities and public engagement through media, workshops and events.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        EvOCRO will expand scientific understanding of reptile cognition, provide novel longitudinal datasets and
        contribute to comparative evolutionary research beyond classical model species.
      </p>
      <p>
        The findings will support conservation, welfare and management strategies in farms, zoos and protected areas, and
        will contribute to several UN Sustainable Development Goals through research, education and public engagement.
