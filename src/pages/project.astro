        EvOCRO investigates how learning and cognitive flexibility develop across the lifespan of crocodiles
        and how individual differences shape these abilities, using Morelet’s crocodile as a model system.

        <h2>Why crocodiles?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Crocodiles belong to Archosauria and diverged from birds over 300 million years ago, offering a key branch for comparative cognition.</li>
          <li>They show complex behaviour but remain understudied because of logistical and safety challenges in the field.</li>
          <li>Understanding their cognition can inform conservation, animal welfare and the design of better enrichment and release programmes.</li>

          <li><strong>RO1 – Ontogeny of learning:</strong> how cognitive abilities change from hatchlings to juveniles of different ages.</li>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          EvOCRO combines behavioural ecology, comparative psychology and evolutionary biology in a partnership
          between Anglia Ruskin University (UK) and CEDESU (Mexico). Controlled farm environments provide access
          to diverse <em>Crocodylus moreletii</em> populations and allow systematic, repeatable experiments under
          ecologically relevant conditions.

      <h2>Why crocodiles?</h2>
      <p>
        Crocodiles are long-lived predators with sophisticated sensory systems and flexible behaviour, yet their
        cognition has been explored far less than that of birds or mammals. Studying cognition in crocodilians
        helps to bridge an important evolutionary gap within Archosauria and to challenge the bias that only
        “classically complex” species are suitable models for cognitive research.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, personality traits such as boldness, shyness or exploration can affect how individuals
        learn, cope with environmental change and survive in the wild. Linking cognition to these traits is highly
        relevant for conservation programmes, rehabilitation and reintroduction, where understanding which animals
        are more likely to thrive can improve management decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Research objectives</h2>
      <p>
        EvOCRO focuses on Morelet’s crocodile (<em>Crocodylus moreletii</em>) through a strategic partnership with
        CEDESU in Campeche, Mexico. The project addresses three main research objectives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>RO1 – Ontogeny of learning (WP1):</strong> quantify how learning abilities develop from hatchlings
          to juveniles (6 months, 1 year, 2 years), including differences between sexes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RO2 – Individual differences in learning (WP2):</strong> test how stable behavioural traits
          along the exploration–shyness spectrum relate to learning performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RO3 – Cognitive flexibility (WP3):</strong> assess how crocodiles update their responses when
          reward contingencies change, using reversal learning tasks to measure flexibility.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Approach and work packages</h2>
      <p>
        EvOCRO is organised into interconnected work packages that combine developmental, individual and
        comparative perspectives with strong training, management and outreach components.
      </p>

      <h3>WP1 – Ontogeny of learning</h3>
      <p>
        WP1 examines how learning develops from hatching to the juvenile stage. Crocodiles are trained with
        a simple visual cue using positive reinforcement, followed by a two-choice discrimination task. Once a
        learning criterion is reached, reward contingencies are reversed to test how performance changes with age
        and sex.
      </p>

      <h3>WP2 – Individual differences</h3>
      <p>
        WP2 uses the same cohort of animals to measure personality traits such as exploration and response to
        novelty or potential threats. These traits are then linked to learning outcomes from WP1 to understand how
        intrinsic behavioural variation shapes cognitive performance.
      </p>

      <h3>WP3 – Cognitive flexibility</h3>
      <p>
        WP3 builds on the familiarisation and learning tasks developed in WP1 to investigate cognitive flexibility.
        By systematically reversing stimulus–reward associations, the project assesses how quickly and accurately
        individuals adapt to new rules, and how this relates to age, personality and past performance.
      </p>

      <h3>WP4 &amp; WP5 – Training, management and communication</h3>
      <p>
        WP4 covers project management and the researcher’s career development, including training in advanced
        statistical methods, open science practices and interdisciplinary collaboration. WP5 focuses on
        communication, dissemination and public engagement, through scientific outputs, workshops, outreach
        activities and digital content.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Scientifically, EvOCRO will expand knowledge of reptile cognition, provide longitudinal data on
        learning and flexibility, and contribute to comparative work across taxa beyond the usual model species.
      </p>
      <p>
        From an applied perspective, the findings can inform conservation strategies, enrichment design and
        welfare practices for crocodiles in farms, zoos and protected areas. The project is also aligned with several
        UN Sustainable Development Goals by linking research, conservation and public engagement.
